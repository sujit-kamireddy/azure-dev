// The harness grades a rollout whether or not it finished, so the index's
// `success` is a task verdict and says nothing about execution. A rollout
// killed by a transport error still carries a reward, a graph and
// success=false, which is indistinguishable at index level from a complete but
// poor attempt: the crashed rollout aea89e72 recorded reward 0.057,
// has_graph=true and an unremarkable 138s latency. Only the agent's own output
// separates them, and that lives in the body.
//
// This matters beyond presentation. A rollout that died mid-flight is still
// graded and still trained on, and because a crash returns `parsed: false` it
// zeroes four reward dimensions -- so a good trajectory enters the gradient
// labelled ~0.13. The share of a run that failed to execute is therefore a
